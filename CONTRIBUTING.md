## Testing

### Observe builds generated by tests

By default, builds generated by tests are cleaned up automatically. If you need to look at the generated files for a test, disable the automatic cleanup by passing the `skipTestCleanup` system property with a value of `true` to the Gradle build.

```shell
./gradlew test --test=JavaBuildIntegrationTest -DskipTestCleanup=true
```

Builds generated by tests will then be found in `build/tmp/tests`.
